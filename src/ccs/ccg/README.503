[.COMP]		[5,3]		Decus C Compiler

This account contains source for the Decus C compiler, the AS
assembler, and the runtime library needed for both.  The runtime
library is a hacked version of a very preliminary version of
the current runtime library, and should not be used for anything
more serious than scaring small children if they don't behave.

There are a bunch of command files in this account, they build
CC and AS as discussed in the "getting on the air" manual, KIT.DOC.
There are a few untested command files, such as *.LEO and TCCVJ.COM
that may be of interest to RT11 users.

It is recommended that you refrain from impulsively editing the compiler.

(There are some untested-by-me patches for people running under TSX-11
in the file DECUSC.FIX.)
