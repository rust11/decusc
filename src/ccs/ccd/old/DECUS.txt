                                   Description

        C  is  a  general  purpose  programming language well suited for
        professional  usage.   The  Decus  C  distribution  contains   a
        complete C programming system including:  

             o  A  compiler  for the C language.  The entire language is
                supported except for macros with arguments, bit  fields,
                enumerations,  structure  assignment,  and  a  few other
                minor features.  

             o  A  common runtime library ('standard I/O library') for C
                programs running under the  RSX-11  or  RT-11  operating
                systems.   By  using  this  library,  C  programs may be
                developed on one operating system for  eventual  use  on
                another.  

             o  A  RSTS/E  extensions  library  allowing  access  to all
                RSTS/E executive services.  

             o  An  RSX-11/M  extensions  library allowing access to all
                RSX-11/M executive services.  

             o  More  than  20  C  programs, including a cross-reference
                lister  for  C  programs,  a  lexical  analyser  program
                generator,  cross-assemblers for several microcomputers,
                and several games.  

             o  Extensive  documentation  for  the  compiler and runtime
                libraries.  

        All software is distributed in source format.  C may be built to
        run under RSTS/E V7.0, RSX-11/M V3.2, RT-11  V3B,  or  VMS  V3.1





        (compatibility  mode).   It  may  be  modified to run on earlier
        versions of these operating systems and should run on subsequent
        versions   without  extensive  modification.   With  some  minor
        restrictions, Decus C and programs written in  Decus  C  may  be
        transported  to  the  PRO-350 P/OS V1.7 and run under control of
        the native toolkit.
